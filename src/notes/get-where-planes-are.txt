-- to get where plane(s) are, the following will need to be coded/built:

get airline info:

from airline info: 
    const airline = getAirlineInfo();

        get all plane IDs:
            iterate over  'airline.aircraft' and get all '_id'

after getting all planes, will then see where each plane is and its status: 
    {
        _id: ####,
        
    }
    


-- Refresh:

    hit airline information endpoint....
        with respones, iterate over flightRoutes property
            from each one, get the last item in 'flightStatusUpdates' array...
                 if it is not status of 'landed', add this '_id' to an array of flights to check...
            once you have this array iterate over it and make API call to Flight Route by ID (https://api.flightfusion.io/api/flightRoute/680695b558581dd41606535e)
                this should hopefully update the airline info with current flight(s) data
